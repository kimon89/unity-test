Ground Earth 

This Essential 3D Block Pack is a work in progress game asset pack. What you are paying for is early access at the lowest possible price. By the end of this asset development, this pack will grow in size and that can be used to create a rapid prototype or a finished game. 

All these game assets have been textured, UV mapped, and unwrapped. The mesh and texture (after compression) are very small. The asset can be easily imported into Unity or an open-source game engine like Superpowers.

Features

Periodic updates
Tutorials on how to import 3D art assets into Unity - Game Engine
Only available on itch.io store
Very clean models/mesh
Mobile safe for Unity projects
Importable into Superpower (COLLADA2glTF converter)

How do I use it?
.fbx, and .obj are 3D formats that can be opened by most 3D programs. The Collada format *.dae can be imported into Superpowers using the COLLADA2gIFT converter. All these formats can be opened in the following 3D programs:

Unity (.fxb)
UE4 (.fbx)
Maya (.fbx, .obj)
3D Max (.fbx, .obj)
Cinema 4D (.fbx, .obj, .dae (Collada 1.4 and 1.5)

3D coat (.fbx)
UV Headus Layout (.obj)



Why Early Access?

I have been making game assets for over the last decade for various team. These are game dev teams that I work with on a daily basis. The project has a certain level of expectation and as a team, we work towards delivering a quality product. Feedback during development cycles are quick and iterative and that keep the entire process of build games moving forward, like a well oiled machine. 
Over the last few months I've started working on making games for the community here at itch.io. With each new release pack, I tend to get contacted by developers who want new assets with a certain game pack. The whole process of building, releasing, getting feedback, and releasing again is a very slow development. Early access allows me to get feedback from developers / clients during and before launch. This means the end product is a lot more tailored to the community's needs.

Funds earned by generous donors help expand the team and get one more artist on board to help make assets faster. The quicker you get new quality assets.



If you like these assets, or have a specific art asset need, please do leave a comment on the store :)

Cheers!
